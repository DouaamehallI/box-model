## Project Structure
### HTML
The HTML file (`index.html`) contains:
- A `<section>` element with the class `gallery-section` to wrap the gallery.
- A `<div>` with the class `gallery` that uses CSS Grid to display the images.
- Each image is wrapped in a `<div>` with the class `gallery-item`.

### CSS
The CSS file (`style.css`) includes:
- **Grid Layout**: The `.gallery` class uses `display: grid` with `grid-template-columns` to create a responsive grid.
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth zoom-in effects are applied to images using `transform` and `transition`.
- **Spacing**: The `gap` property ensures consistent spacing between images.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Add your own images by replacing the `<img>` tags in the HTML file with your image paths.
